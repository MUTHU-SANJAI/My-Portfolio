          <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 mb-12 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, and a deep
          interest in machine learning. Leveraging ML to build intelligent, data-driven solutions is at the core of
          my work. My journey in tech has been driven by a desire to create meaningful digital experiences that solve
          real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
          open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
